### Know the author

I am a 25 year old* Devops/Go developer based on Barcelona, Spain. My carreer up to this point has been oriented to helpdesk and technical support
positions, with a certain period as fulltime devops as well. My main motivation with this blog is both enjoy more aspects of the IT/tech world and expanding my knowledge further, so may be a future job oportunity might include this language as part of my daily tasks.

I stumbled across Golang back in 2022 during my time working at Webhelp Spain (Now Concentrix), as part of the Apigee Support team, as our team looked for 
ways to automate certain tests that we did on a daily basis (i.e specific curls against Apigee's API, operations over the infrastructure, local environment changes etc), and Go seemed like the most approachable option.

Hope anyone reading this blog finds it as an inspiration, it is not an easy challenge to go over, also it can become frustrating to learn solo. I am fortunate enough that I surounded myself with friends and communities that push me forward into solving my own doubts and programming-related problems I find along the way. Special thanks to Juan and Mar√≠a, I don't know how to make it up to how much you have supported me.
