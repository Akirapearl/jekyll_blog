Hey!

Today I started moving to a new place within my country, so I will not be able to code for a while (expected 2 weeks, tops),
this makes me a bit anxious about losing habits and knowledge, but I hope I get back soon and will be back at it.

Can't wait to start again!


I also want to take advantage of this and share a little bit of my music taste. I love sum 41 since my early teens
(I'm 25 at the time of writing) and soon enough I will be attending to may be one of the last concert from this band 
here in Spain, since they announced their disbandment/retirement earlier this year.

So here it's one of their songs from the latest setlist* I could find online. Enjoy!
