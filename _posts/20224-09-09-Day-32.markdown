### Quick note about the duration of this challenge

Back on the seventh of October, I made it to the technically 92th day of this challenge, if I were to do at least an hour of coding
somehow each day, but it is not as easy when you have a full-time job, other studies ongoing (as for myself, I'm also currently studying
catalonian) and other obligations. 

I've already accepted that I won't be able to finish this challenge by the expected date goal (November 19th), yet I believe that making this
learning process part of my routine until the end of the year or so, updating this blog with my progress and my will to learn should be fine

I don't want to make excuses, yet it is true that I feel how life has goten in between, making me a bit of lack in practice and context for what
I came to learn upon this point.

That being said, let's get back to it.

#### Day 32 - 25/10/2024

Today I kept it easy on myself and got back to the book I was reading, I finished another chapter! This one was about error handling and logging.
Now I am on the verge of getting introduced to how to use MySQL databases and all, also almost finished the first quarter of the book thus far!,
so I think that stopping here and focusing onto the CRUD part of my own project would be interesting to know, so when I learn about databases I can actually apply it on my own project of sorts.

#### Day 33 - 26/10/2024
