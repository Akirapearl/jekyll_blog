Hi!

This is my very first post created for this Github site.

I have been trying out blog/static sites frameworks for the last couple of days, some of them quite 
know around the dev communities, like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), yet i've decided to stick with Jekyll,
since i feel it is easier to use and customize (with or without themes).

For the next couple of weeks I will be experimenting with its esthetics and general behavior, so I will not
bother too much afterwards for it to look prettier and will just focus on my project:

### 100 days of code

As disclaimed in the subtitle, my idea with this blog/static site is to document my journey with a project I
shall finish within 100 days, with a couple of considerations. [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

  1 - I will only document my progress using this blog, so the entire experience will remain public.
  
  2 - I will NOT stick to the 100 days policy, at least not to the letter, as my main idea is to attempt
  to finish this before November 19th, as a way to celebrate my 26th birthday and close a year full of new
  experiences and self-improvement.

At the time of writing my main ideas for this challenge are as follows:

  > Finish my [homelab](https://github.com/Akirapearl/homelab) configuration. Adding the services I see of use during the process, and automate it
  via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

  > Expand my knowledge base by finishing Odin Project's intermediate JS path and applying it to my current Github site.

That being said, this is all for today's entry.

See you next time!
