Hi!

This is my second entry on this 100 days journey.

Now, I really wanted to know what to expect on each aspect of this challenge, and since I already have had some familiarity
with Ansible, I took the chance over Odin Project [JS path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) to see what
contents does it really cover and how (practical or theoretical approach).

As matter of fact, Odin's REALLY into theory-oriented learning, even though it provides external links for practical exercises,
it does not really provide those for its own platform. Honestly I do prefer a mixed way; where a part of theory is shown/tested 
and then proposed to be applied over a challenge/exercise, kind of like freecodecamp does, even so, notes are really clear and easy
to understand.

As a sidenote,at least only matters for HTML and CSS learning, I do feel quite numb/exasperated, as those have been a returned topic to learn
for me, about 3 times at the time of writing, this one being the 4th, which makes this part really tedious to go over, even if I get to know more
about this topic.

Lastly, I've collected some resources to maximize my learning and to help me out reach Odin's own challenges with a better mindset,
those can be checked at my newly created [repo](https://github.com/Akirapearl/odin_project).


### What I learned

- I don't remember that much of the basics, yet I can catch up no problem, I do completely understand quite fine any code I've read so far.
- I don't really remember flexbox or grid either, these two are quite a mistery again.
- There are some resources I can follow within Odin's site, not everything is purely theoretical!.
- I did not know about resets and reboots for CSS styling, quite fun to see those in action!.


### Next steps

Now that I understand the structure for Odin's project site, I can better plan my approach to it etc.
For this, I will be using my above mentioned repo to upload everything I create, ideally it will be useful to record my learning process, my ups and downs etc. 

Even with all this, I believe that I WON'T be mixing topics, meaning that I will first focus on either Ansible OR Web-dev/Odin's and will only change on a 
daily basis when I feel either too frustrated, exhausted or feeling any sort of refreshment.

Once I'm done with the two challenges I have over my shoulders for this very 100 days topic, I will post a showcase of what I've done so far,
as well as reflecting everything over their respective repos.

That's all for today,

See you next time!
