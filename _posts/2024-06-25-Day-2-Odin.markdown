Hi!

This is my second entry on this 100 days journey.

Now, I really wanted to know what to expect on each aspect of this challenge, and since I already have had some familiarity
with Ansible, I took the chance over Odin Project [JS path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) to see what
contents does it really cover and how (practical or theoretical approach).

As matter of fact, Odin's really, and I want to emphasize, REALLY into theory-oriented learning, even though it provides external links,
it does not really does so for its own platform, which I am not really into, as I prefer a mixed way; where a part of theory is shown/tested 
and then I can just apply over a challenge/exercise, kind of like freecodecamp's.

As a sidenote, I hope that this situation only matters for HTML and CSS learning, as those have been a returned topic to learn
about about 3 times at the time of writing, this one being the 4th, which makes this part really tedious.

Even so, I've collected some resources to maximize my learning and to help me out reach Odin's own challenges with a better mindset,
those can be checked at my newly created [repo](https://github.com/Akirapearl/odin_project).


### What I learned

- I don't remember that much of the basics, yet I can catch up no problem, I do completely understand quite fine any code I've read so far.
- I don't really remember flexbox or grid either, these two are quite a mistery again.
- There are some resources I can follow within Odin's site, not everything is purely theoretical!.
- I did not know about resets and reboots for CSS styling, quite fun to see those in action!.


### Next steps

Now that I understand the structure for Odin's project site, I can better plan my approach to it etc.
For this, I will be using my above mentioned repo to upload everything I create, ideally it will be useful to record my learning process, my ups and downs etc. 

Even with all this, I believe that I WON'T be mixing topics, meaning that I will first focus on either Ansible OR Web-dev/Odin's and will only change on a 
daily basis when I feel either too frustrated, exhausted or feeling any sort of refreshment.

Once I'm done with the two challenges I have over my shoulders for this very 100 days topic, I will post a showcase of what I've done so far,
as well as reflecting everything over their respective repos.

That's all for today,

See you next time!
