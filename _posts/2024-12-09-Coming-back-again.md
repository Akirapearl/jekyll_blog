Oh well... Hi there!

A bit of a time off, right? Last time I wrote a post entry for my blog was mid-November, but I am ongoing quite some stuff on my personal life, so had to figure out how to focus and enjoy coding again, let's get to it, then!.

#### Day 44 - Starting somewhere - Let's do a tutorial about RESTful APIs

Might sound a bit easy-going, but since I've been struggling quite a bit with focus and trying to get my mind to code, I believe that a copy-paste kind of tutorial could be a way to come back, as of the time of writing, I might be correct, I wanted to do more once I finished!.

In summary, I followed [this tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin*/) that covers how to use Golang and Gin framework in a simple way to operate GET and POST operations, my next steps on this might be even making this API bigger, since by default no information is stored persistently, a CSV file or a simple SQL database collection might be useful for this.
