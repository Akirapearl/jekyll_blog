Hi!

This is my very first post created for this Github site.

I have been trying out blog/static sites frameworks recently, some of them quite 
know around the dev communities, like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), yet i've decided to stick with Jekyll,
since i feel it is easier to use and customize (with or without themes).

For the next couple of weeks I will be experimenting with its esthetics and general behavior, so I will not
bother too much afterwards for it to look prettier and will just focus on my project:

### 100 days of code

My idea with this blog/static site is to document my journey with a learning process I
shall "finish"* within 100 days, with a couple of considerations. [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

  1 - I will only document my progress using this blog, so the entire experience will remain public and non-social media related.
  
  2 - I will NOT stick to the 100 days policy, at least not to the letter, as my main idea is to attempt
  to finish this before November 19th, as a way to celebrate my 26th birthday and close a year full of new
  experiences and self-improvement.*

### So...How does my starting point looks like?

At the time of writing my main idea for this challenge is to learn Golang, so I can add further possibilities
to my own knowledge toolbox.

Current toolbox as a sysadmin/devops:
```
- Linux/Windows Administration
- Google Cloud
- Apigee
- Ansible
- Docker/Kubernetes Admin
- Database Querying and server Administration (MySQL, Postgre, Oracle...)
- Basic Web development (HTML/CSS/JS/PHP)
- Github/Gitlab general usage
- Bash scripting
- Grafana/Zabbix - User
- Proxmox/KVM (QEMU), VMWare, Virtualbox
```

That being said, I believe it is time to move onto the actual challenge,

See you next time!

*finish: I believe that learning never ends, but setting up a good pace of "doing" and introducing a new technology or habit
within my rutine via this very same blog can be of use in multiple ways.

*Update - Oct 2024 - I will not be able to finish on that date, yet I will carry on and hope to finish before new year's eve.
