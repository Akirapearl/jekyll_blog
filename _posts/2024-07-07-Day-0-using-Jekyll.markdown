Hi!

This is my very first post created for this Github site.

I have been trying out blog/static sites frameworks recently, some of them quite 
know around the dev communities, like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), yet i've decided to stick with Jekyll,
since i feel it is easier to use and customize (with or without themes).

For the next couple of weeks I will be experimenting with its esthetics and general behavior, so I will not
bother too much afterwards for it to look prettier and will just focus on my project:

### 100 days of code

My idea with this blog/static site is to document my journey with a project I
shall finish within 100 days, with a couple of considerations. [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

  1 - I will only document my progress using this blog, so the entire experience will remain public.
  
  2 - I will NOT stick to the 100 days policy, at least not to the letter, as my main idea is to attempt
  to finish this before November 19th, as a way to celebrate my 26th birthday and close a year full of new
  experiences and self-improvement.

### So...How does my starting point looks like?

At the time of writing my main idea for this challenge is to learn Golang, so I can add further possibilities
to my own knowledge toolbox.

Current toolbox as a sysadmin:
```
- Linux/Windows Sysadmin
- Google Cloud
- Ansible
- Docker/Kubernetes Admin
```

Other tech/IT related knowledge:
```
- HTML/CSS/JS/PHP
- Git
- Bash
- MySQL/MongoDB
```

That's all for today,

See you next time!
