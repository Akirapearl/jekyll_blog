Welcome to my very first day at the 100 days of code trip!

First things first, I would like to mention that no art showed over any entry/post of this blog will be disclaimed as 
belonged to me unless specifically said so, all original images will be added at the end of each post 
so the original authors can be properly reflected.

### So, about DAY 1's intentionality, setup and original concept

Truth being told, it can bee seen at this very same repo that there were a bunch of commits, oriented to a previous idea I took 
for this very same challenge, even so, I decided to move on from a wider and way more complex objective, in favor of a more focused
and feasible objective, which will be to become more experienced with Golang.

The original idea's progress can be briefly seen below.

Moving on, how does my current setup look like? Well, my current Operative System is PopOS, running on a custom PC, I already have Golang
installed on its almost latest version (currently 1.22.2, at the time of writing latest is 1.22.5).

My idea with this project, as vaguely described at Day 0's post, is adding further possibilities to my knowledge toolbox. As Golang
is a multi-purpose programming language, I will set the goal into learning as much as I can build a tool or proper snippet of code of my own,
starting from scratch.

### What now? Where do I start learning?

How will I be learning then? 

As I am just starting, I remember going through Techworld with Nana's youtube channel and finding this
really nice [introductory course](https://youtu.be/yyUHQIec83I?si=xrfis_DrpVzmbJYy). After that, I will look for more focused learning, 
well methodologies can be followed up like testing or [webapps-focused](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/), at the same time I am already
aware of specific creators as [Roberto Morais](https://www.youtube.com/@FuenRob).

That would be it for this one,

See you next time!
