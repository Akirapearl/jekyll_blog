Hi!

Summer 2024 is being quite dificult to handle here in Spain, also living in a coast city with loads of humidity and kind of surrounded by social media
is hard for the attention span and not the best while working with computers. As for now I've been trying to continue with this challenge 
during weekend mornings and week's night time (before midnights).

For the following 3 to 5 days tops, until day 10's post, I will be moving around standalone tutorials/guides, including Go's Tour, and trying to build smaller things that use the basics of Go separately, increasingly using more of them, yet I want to figure out bigger projects I can assign and dedicate more time.

Because of that, I made up a general planification, so I can try to follow up a learning program of sorts, it is not definitive by all means, just a general guideline to take into account:

```
- Lap/Week 1 (Days 1 to 10) - Learn the basics, smaller exercises.
    - Tutorials, Go Tour etc.
    - Codewars
    - Start Advent of code
    - First API
- Lap/Week 2 (Days 11 to 20) - Certified courses and workshop, define potential usage for web/server usage.
    - Advent of code (II)
    - Gophercises
    - Let's Go (web) / Web Programming 
        - To-do app template w/http-server?
- Lap/Week 3 (Days 21 to 30) - More practice, more projects
    - Pomodoro app with Parse JSON exercise integrated? (Day 3)
        - Save previous sessions and output them in a sort of history list?
    - Finish Advent of Code
    - Let's Go (web) / Web Programming in Go
```

Future ideas/concepts I might take into consideration are:
```
    - Go Codecrafter's challenges
    - Discord bots
        - User Ranking
        - D&D Custom dice throw or choice picker*
    - Linux networking toolbox - Connect to known networks, flush DNS, reboot network interface if needed
    - Linux automation tool - Deploy dotfiles, report system settings in a fastfetch-like kind of way.
```

Choice picker: Prompt a situatioon as "Your party appears at a city, crowded with people, there's a market etc" and the bot shall show 4 buttons,
for the players to vote which action each wants to do.

### So what have I done today?

It would seem that some parts of Go's Tour area bit difficult for me to understand entirely, as it happened with pointers. Thus, I started a wider scoped [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uiZC0l4Ajw), which covers most of Go's syntax into an intermediate level and quite fast, yet it serves as complete-ish refresher. Ideally after finishing it I shall be able to understand most Golang's possibilities and start a project of my own.

In on itself that was quite intense. With the tutorial half gone-by, I did some codewars exercises over my [Learning Go repo](https://github.com/Akirapearl/LearningGo/tree/main/2024/exercises) 


### Fair enough, next steps then?

As disclosed above, I've got quite a ride to follow up during the following weeks, thus I've decided that, from now on, I will report just once a week, writing less posts into this blog will also allow me to focus more on doing rather than thinking about how to structure this learning process or how to make the blog prettier.

That would be it for now then.

See you next week!
